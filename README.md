# keybinds
## my keybinds for GNOME shell!

## In a Nutshell
These are my personal keybinds which I use for my workflow. This repository has a script to import / export keybinds, and to add them to this repository. I'll regularly update the `keybinds.conf` file with my settings.

You probably shouldn't use these, but you can if you wish.

## Features
- Exports and Imports GNOME keyboard shortcuts
     - uses `dconf-editor`
     - exports to a .conf file
     - imports my keybinds from the existing .conf file

## Installation
1. Download the Script
2. Give permissions to execute the script
    - do `chmod +x keymanager.sh`
3. Run the Script
4. Follow the on screen instructions
